# solve_poisson
This code solves numerically the Poisson equation for a given 3D mass density distribution and computes the gravitational potential. It can also compute numerically the cumulative mass profile. The repository also contains useful routines with analytical and numerical solutions for the mass and potential for the gNFW density distribution.
